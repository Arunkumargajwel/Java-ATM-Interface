# Java-ATM-Interface

## Project Description
The ATM Interface Project is a Java-based console application that simulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This project allows users to perform the following operations:

- **Register**: Users can create an account by setting up a username and PIN.
- **Login**: Users can securely log in using their credentials.
- **Check Balance**: View the current account balance.
- **Deposit**: Add money to the account.
- **Withdraw**: Withdraw money from the account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Transfer**: Transfer funds to another user by specifying the recipient's name and amount.
- **Exit**: End the session.

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and user interaction through the console.

1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above.
   - Install an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) or use the terminal/command prompt to compile and run the project.
